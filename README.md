# upsetsysadmins
A tool that will really upset your sysadmin

This is a tool that can rename a process so that it appears to be something else when you look in "ps" than it really is.

## Disclaimer

Don't run this on things you don't want to get totally broken. This tool
performs process memory modifications and may not get it right, corrupting
the process. Thus the `renameeverything.go` really is as bad of a idea as
it sounds.
